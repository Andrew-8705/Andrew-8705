## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at **Lobachevsky University** in pursuing a degree in **Fundamental Informatics and Information Technologies**.

Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of **C/C++ programming**. This repository serves as a space for me to explore, learn, and document my progress as I build my skills.
